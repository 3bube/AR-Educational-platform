# AR Educational Platform üë©‚Äçüè´üåç  

Welcome to the **AR Educational Platform**, an innovative learning platform that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) to create immersive and interactive educational experiences. Built using **React**, **Node.js**, and **Supabase**, this project is designed to make learning engaging and accessible.  

## Features ‚ú®  
- **Augmented Reality Lessons**: Deliver interactive AR-based content for enhanced learning.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure and scalable authentication powered by Supabase.  
- **Customizable Curriculum**: Tailor lessons and modules to suit specific learning needs.  
- **Cloud-Backed Data Storage**: All content and user data are managed with Supabase for seamless access and updates.  

## Getting Started üöÄ  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:  

### 1. Install Dependencies  

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:  

```bash  
npm install  
```  

### 2. Start the Development Server  

Start the application using Expo's development tools:  

```bash  
npx expo start  
```  

Choose one of the following methods to view the app:  
- **Development Build**: Run a development version of the app.  
- **Android Emulator**: Use an Android emulator with [Android Studio](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).  
- **iOS Simulator**: Test the app on an iOS simulator.  
- **Expo Go**: Preview the app on a physical device using the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app.  

### 3. Start Developing  

Begin editing the project files inside the **app** directory. This project utilizes [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for streamlined navigation and organization.  

## Resetting the Project  

If you'd like to reset the project to a fresh state, run:  

```bash  
npm run reset-project  
```  

This will back up the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a new blank **app** directory for your development.  

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è  
- **Frontend**: Developed with React and integrated with Expo for cross-platform functionality.  
- **Backend**: Node.js powers the server-side logic, while Supabase handles authentication and database operations.
